Programmers shall think to the polution against better than anyone else.  
IT managers have to change their "Hardware is cheap, developers are expensives" point of view, they forgot `sustainable development`.
Hardware (conception, utilisation and recycling) do pollute much more than few development hours.

**We have to use as minimal hardware and electricity resources as we can.**

This project is built using https://github.com/MarcFaussurier/CWithMinimalism AND https://github.com/MarcFaussurier/promise-cpp

This event loop uses its own thread scheduler to optimise the amount of threads used by the event loop to match your CPU.

Blocking the event loop is not a problem anymore. Software will profile your functions to proceed differently with blocking operations.
